# Corrective direct formal-source spherical-Jeans rerun

## Why this record exists

Jeans-v2 evaluated an empirical nuisance-orthogonal **response-space** adapter.
That is a valid experiment for its own adapter, but it did not answer the
requested canonical-equation question. This corrective record preserves
Jeans-v2 unchanged and separately executes the direct formal-source insertion.

## Equation comparison

Baseline:

$$
\frac{d(\nu\sigma_r^2)}{dr}+\frac{2\beta}{r}\nu\sigma_r^2
=-\nu\frac{G M_{\rm base}(<r)}{r^2},
\qquad M_{\rm base}=M_\star+M_{\rm NFW}.
$$

Direct orthogonal density and mass:

$$
\rho_\perp(r)=f\left[(K_d*\rho_{\rm NFW})(r)-\rho_{\rm NFW}(r)\right],
$$

$$
M_\perp(<r)=4\pi\int_0^r\rho_\perp(r')r'^2dr'.
$$

Augmented equation:

$$
\frac{d(\nu\sigma_r^2)}{dr}+\frac{2\beta}{r}\nu\sigma_r^2
=-\nu\frac{G\left[M_{\rm base}(<r)+M_\perp(<r)\right]}{r^2}.
$$

Equivalently,
`rho_h,aug=(1-f)rho_NFW+f(K_d*rho_NFW)`. The operator acts on the
three-dimensional NFW halo density only. Stellar mass and tracer density are
not convolved. No response projection or free residual map is used.

## Development calibration

Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans were development galaxies. The shared
search covered `f in {0, 0.05, ..., 1}` and
`eta in {0.03125, ..., 8}`, with `d_g=eta*r_half,g`.

- Safe optimum: `f=0`, `eta=0.03125`, exact baseline preservation.
- Best nonzero diagnostic: `f=0.05`, `eta=0.03125`.
- The nonzero diagnostic worsened the development macro score; only `1/4`
  development galaxies improved. It was frozen only to measure direct
  direction on the corrective evaluation set, not adopted.

## Audit and replay

- OmarAGI R2 executed-source pre/post gates: PASS.
- Direct equation/source identity: PASS.
- Response-adapter callable absent: PASS.
- Exact `f=0` prediction recovery: PASS.
- Finite-grid mass-conservation gates: PASS.
- Arithmetic and object-identity audit: `61/61` checks PASS.
- Fresh-process replay preserved policy identity, delta signs, and direction
  counts. Floating-point outputs were numerically equivalent but not byte
  identical because the baseline L-BFGS-B fits shifted at sub-micro parameter
  scale.
- The packaged public evaluation replay reproduced all four aggregate raw deltas
  and direction counts exactly (`max raw-delta difference = 0`).

## Proof boundary

**Label:**
`CORRECT_FORMAL_SOURCE_DIRECTIONAL_DELTA_NEGATIVE_BUT_MATERIALITY_NOT_ESTABLISHED`.

Draco and Ursa Minor had already been exposed under the off-object Jeans-v2
response experiment, so this is a post-exposure corrective reproduction, not
fresh/unseen proof. The development-safe decision remained `f=0`; the nonzero
candidate is not adopted. The approximately `0.0051%` reduction is a tiny
forced-direction diagnostic, not material uplift, unique-kernel evidence, or a
physical/cosmological claim. Candidate nuisance parameters were not refit.
