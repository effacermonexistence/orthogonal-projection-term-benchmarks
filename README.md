# Orthogonal Projection Term — Cosmology Residual Benchmarks

**OmarAGI research record.** This repository preserves the equations, frozen insertions, public-data provenance, diagnostic scores, matched controls, and negative results from an exploratory orthogonal redistribution-term program.

The object tested throughout the core lanes is:

$$
\mathcal O_\perp[X] = f_\perp\left(\mathcal K_d[X]-X\right),
\qquad
X_{\mathrm{aug}}=(1-f_\perp)X+f_\perp\mathcal K_d[X].
$$

It does **not** create mass by construction when the kernel is normalized on the full domain; it redistributes a selected component. The earlier fixed-scale lanes freeze `f_perp = 0.30` and `d = 16 kpc`. The SPARC lane freezes one development-selected equation adapter, `f = 1.0` and `d_g = 0.125 R_disk,g`, before heldout evaluation. Here `f = 1.0` is the full-smoothed-profile replacement endpoint of the declared operator family, not the earlier partial `f = 0.30` mixture. The first dwarf-spheroidal Jeans lane independently calibrates the same density-adapter grammar and selects the safe baseline, `f = 0`. A separate Jeans-v2 experiment tests a nuisance-orthogonal response-space adapter; it is not a canonical source insertion. The corrective formal-source record then inserts the term directly into the spherical-Jeans halo-density source for Draco and Ursa Minor while preserving the post-exposure proof boundary.

The X-COP lane separately places the same three-dimensional redistribution
grammar directly into the hydrostatic-equilibrium mass source. Its
development-frozen shared policy is evaluated on three untouched cluster
identities with no row-level fallback. Its selected `f = 1.0` is likewise the
full-replacement endpoint, not the legacy partial mixture.

## Conceptual origin

The hypothesis did not begin as a fit to cosmology data. It began with an
ordinary mixed-reality observation in a fully immersive Vision Pro
environment: the rendered scene made nearby space appear open, while an
unrendered physical wall still constrained movement. That mismatch prompted a
structural question: can the field available to an observer omit a boundary
that remains active in the larger constraint system?

Einstein and Rosen's two-sheet bridge construction then supplied a geometric
motif, not a physical derivation. The project retained the abstraction of
linked descriptions and a constraint-bearing structure outside the baseline
representation. It did **not** infer that mixed reality reveals cosmology,
that a white hole or hidden sheet has been observed, or that the operator
follows from the Einstein-Rosen metric.

The motif was converted into the bounded, falsifiable redistribution operator
shown above. The later benchmark program tests that operator against public
data and matched generic controls. Its results—not the origin story—determine
the empirical status. See
[`docs/CONCEPTUAL_ORIGIN.md`](docs/CONCEPTUAL_ORIGIN.md) for the full
provenance and boundary.

## What the record shows

| Diagnostic | Frozen directional result | Matched-control result | Evidence boundary |
|---|---:|---|---|
| HFF public lens-model maps, 6 clusters | Negative residual delta in 6/6; Plummer-like reductions 4.96%–27.99% | Generic Gaussian/top-hat also improved 6/6 and beat Plummer-like in 5/6 | Generic low-pass/model-product effect |
| AS1063 true-density B2 | 19.857% residual reduction | Gaussian 19.011%; top-hat 18.681% | Plummer slightly best, but specificity unresolved |
| SIDM Concerto Halo000 | 29.366% residual reduction | Gaussian/top-hat about 29.44% | Direction pass; Plummer specificity fail |
| SIDM Concerto Halo352, fresh target | 41.000% residual reduction | Gaussian 42.129%; top-hat 42.581% | Direction pass; Plummer specificity fail |
| SPARC rotation curves, shared-adapter heldout | 208.845 → 199.589 χ²; 4.432% reduction; 5/6 stable galaxies improved | Gaussian 2.620%; top-hat 2.413%; Plummer best in aggregate but beat both controls per galaxy only 3/6 | `f=1` full-replacement boundary; aggregate advantage over Gaussian is entirely concentrated in NGC5585, where all kernels worsened; diagnostic, not specificity or clean predictive proof |
| Dwarf-spheroidal spherical Jeans, shared-adapter heldout | Safe calibration selected `f=0`; forced Plummer 35.352827 → 35.354732 χ² | Gaussian/top-hat were also near-neutral but adverse in aggregate | Adopted policy recovered the exact baseline; the adverse forced-nonzero diagnostic was not adopted |
| Jeans-v2 nuisance-orthogonal response, untouched-galaxy heldout | 22.835649 → 24.085741 χ²; -5.474% residual reduction; 0/2 improved | Gaussian -5.331%; top-hat -3.202%; all three worsened both galaxies | Historical off-object response-adapter result; excluded from the canonical direct-source method tally |
| Corrective direct formal-source Jeans insertion, post-exposure | 22.835648 → 22.834488 χ²; +0.005077% residual reduction; 2/2 negative deltas | Gaussian +0.000709%; top-hat +0.000534% | Correct canonical equation object; replaces Jeans-v2 for the direct-source question, but remains post-exposure and materially tiny |
| X-COP direct hydrostatic-equation insertion, cluster heldout | 145.095308 → 140.737785 χ²; 3.0032% reduction; 3/3 negative deltas | Gaussian 2.1042%; top-hat 1.5773%; Plummer best in aggregate but beat both controls per cluster only 1/3 | `f=1` full-replacement boundary; A644 alone exceeds the total Plummer-over-Gaussian aggregate advantage; public-profile consistency diagnostic, not specificity or independent raw likelihood |
| N13-style development likelihood | raw delta chi-square -1.2543 | 20th percentile under null; baryonic countermodel absorbs residual | Development negative / not proof |
| H(z) background-fluid lane | raw delta chi-square -0.00874 | AIC and BIC worsen | Separate Program C term; no real uplift |

**Supported reading:** inserting a frozen redistribution term can move selected public model products, parametric profiles, or heldout shared-adapter residuals in the favorable direction under the stored metric. The adopted Jeans-v1 policy selected the exact baseline (`f=0`), so it produced no adopted downlift. Jeans-v2 tested a different response-space construction and is excluded from the canonical direct-source method tally. When the requested source object was restored, the corrective direct-source run moved both deltas slightly negative, although development still selected `f=0` and the aggregate reduction was only about 0.0051%. In the X-COP direct hydrostatic lane, the frozen shared insertion reduced aggregate heldout pressure chi-square by 3.0032% with 3/3 negative deltas, while matched generic smoothers also improved 3/3. The SPARC and X-COP Plummer aggregate rankings remain valid arithmetic, but per-unit comparisons (`3/6` and `1/3`) and dominant-unit concentration do not establish Plummer specificity.

**Not supported:** a new physical source, a Plummer-specific mechanism, a detection of hidden geometry, a replacement for GR/LambdaCDM, or an observational-likelihood improvement. In the strongest fresh 3D control, generic smoothers performed slightly better than Plummer.

## Why publish this

Scientific iteration is easier to audit when positive deltas, failed specificity tests, reused samples, and superseded interpretations remain in one durable public record. This repository therefore includes the negative results rather than hiding them.

## Verify the published record

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[test]'
python scripts/verify_published_results.py
pytest -q
```

To reproduce one HFF cluster after obtaining the public FITS maps, take
that cluster's frozen `d_arcsec` from
[`results/hff_six_cluster_transfer.json`](results/hff_six_cluster_transfer.json):

```bash
python scripts/reproduce_hff_transfer.py \
  --target CATS_kappa_best.fits \
  --reference GLAFIC_kappa_best.fits \
  --reference WILLIAMS_kappa_best.fits \
  --d-arcsec <stored-d-arcsec> \
  --output reproduced_cluster.json
```

The adapter WCS-resamples the reference maps, applies the frozen 60-arcsec
scoring mask, and half-mass-matches both generic controls to the discrete
finite Plummer-like kernel before scoring.

Large external FITS archives and simulation tables are not redistributed. Download instructions and source hashes are in [`docs/DATA_PROVENANCE.md`](docs/DATA_PROVENANCE.md).

The SPARC public-data reproduction path is documented in
[`scripts/sparc/README.md`](scripts/sparc/README.md). Its full development grid,
heldout rows, matched controls, verification receipt, and pre-heldout failures
are preserved under [`results/`](results/).

The dwarf-spheroidal Jeans path is documented in
[`scripts/jeans/README.md`](scripts/jeans/README.md). Its full development grid,
safe and forced policies, heldout rows, matched controls, verification receipt,
and pre-heldout failures are also preserved under [`results/`](results/).

The separate Jeans-v2 path is documented in
[`scripts/jeans_v2/README.md`](scripts/jeans_v2/README.md). Its public dev and
heldout replays are byte-identical to the published artifacts. The negative
result remains valid for that response adapter, but it is not counted as a
failure of the canonical direct-source orthogonal insertion.

The corrective direct-source path is documented in
[`scripts/jeans_formal_corrective/README.md`](scripts/jeans_formal_corrective/README.md). It preserves Jeans-v2 as a separate response-adapter result and records the direct canonical-equation correction without upgrading it to fresh proof.

The X-COP direct hydrostatic-equation path is documented in
[`scripts/xcop_hse/README.md`](scripts/xcop_hse/README.md). It downloads the
official profile archive, reproduces the deterministic split, calibrates the
shared policy on four clusters, evaluates the frozen policy on three untouched
cluster identities, and reruns the arithmetic audit.
